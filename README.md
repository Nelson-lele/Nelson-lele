# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nelson Tawiah Kyeremeh, a passionate university student with a love for programming and a deep appreciation for anime. 
Currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at University of Mines and Technology in Ghana and first year student.
I enjoy exploring various programming languages and technologies. 
In my free time, I love watching anime, play volleyball.


Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

Weather App: A program that fetches data from an api and display it nicely.
CLI Todolist: Allows user to add,update retrieve and delete tasks using the terminal.
Typing Speeding App



Feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate on a project, discuss programming, or share anime recommendations!
